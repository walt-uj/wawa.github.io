<!-- Experience -->
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>With a wealth of experience as a professional sportsman, I've been playing ice hockey since I was very young, and I've always evolved in an environment shaped by the demands of top-level sport, but also by a strong team spirit. As a sports enthusiast, I've had the opportunity during my career to meet professionals in the sector and to take part in sporting events, both as a player and as a volunteer. I've always been attracted by the excitement and energy that emanate from such events. This led me to take an interest in the 'backstage' world of sport, which is becoming increasingly professionalized.</p>

<!-- Education -->
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Sports Management from the University of Paris Nanterre. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Marketing and Commerce from ESG Paris business school. I'm now doing a Master's at Kedge Marseille to continue my academic studies in a professional sports environment.</p>
